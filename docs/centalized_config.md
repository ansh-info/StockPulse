Key changes and improvements in this updated version:

1. Configuration Management:

- Centralized configuration in `config.py`
- Separate API keys for each stock
- Individual BigQuery table names for each stock
- Easy to add new stocks by updating the `STOCK_CONFIGS` dictionary

2. Rate Limiting:

- Added sleep between API calls (12 seconds for free tier - 5 calls per minute)
- Each stock uses its own API key to maximize available rate limits

3. Data Organization:

- Separate BigQuery tables for each stock
- Organized GCS storage by stock symbol
- Maintained same schema across all stock tables

4. Process Flow:

- Single Pub/Sub topic for all stocks
- Messages include stock symbol for routing
- BigQuery loader automatically creates tables for all configured stocks
- Each stock's data goes to its own table

To set this up:

1. Update `config.py` with your additional API keys and stock symbols
2. Create the necessary BigQuery tables (the loader will do this automatically)
3. Update any existing BigQuery queries to point to the correct tables
4. Test with a small subset of stocks first
5. Monitor the rate limits and adjust the sleep time if needed
