Here's how you can set the background of your Streamlit app to white by configuring the theme:

---

### **Step 1: Locate or Create the `.streamlit` Directory**

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to your project root directory:
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/your/project
   ```
3. If the `.streamlit` directory does not exist, create it:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p .streamlit
   ```

---

### **Step 2: Create or Update the `config.toml` File**

1. Inside the `.streamlit` directory, create a `config.toml` file if it doesn't exist:
   ```bash
   touch .streamlit/config.toml
   ```
2. Open the `config.toml` file in a text editor of your choice (e.g., `vim`, `nano`, or any code editor).

---

### **Step 3: Add the Theme Configuration**

Add the following lines to the `config.toml` file:

```toml
[theme]
base = "light"
```

This sets the app to use the light theme, which includes a white background.

---

### **Step 4: Restart Your Streamlit App**

1. Save the `config.toml` file.
2. Restart your Streamlit app by running:
   ```bash
   streamlit run your_app.py
   ```
   Replace `your_app.py` with the actual filename of your Streamlit script.

---

### **Step 5: Verify the Changes**

Visit your Streamlit app in the browser. The background should now be white. If it doesnâ€™t change:

- Clear your browser cache and refresh the page.
- Double-check the configuration file for typos.
- Ensure you are running the app from the directory containing the `.streamlit` folder.

---

These steps will ensure your Streamlit app uses the light theme with a white background.
