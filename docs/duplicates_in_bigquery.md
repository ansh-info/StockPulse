To check for duplicates in the `stock-data-pipeline-444011.stock_market.amazon_stock_raw` table in BigQuery, you can identify rows with the same values in one or more fields that you consider the keys for uniqueness. Based on the schema you provided, the combination of `timestamp` and `symbol` might represent unique records, but you can adjust this based on your understanding of the data.

Hereâ€™s an SQL query to find duplicate rows:

```sql
SELECT
  timestamp,
  symbol,
  COUNT(*) AS duplicate_count
FROM
  `stock-data-pipeline-444011.stock_market.amazon_stock_raw`
GROUP BY
  timestamp,
  symbol
HAVING
  COUNT(*) > 1
ORDER BY
  duplicate_count DESC;
```

### Explanation:

1. **`SELECT timestamp, symbol, COUNT(*)`**: This counts how many rows have the same combination of `timestamp` and `symbol`.
2. **`GROUP BY timestamp, symbol`**: Groups the data by `timestamp` and `symbol` to aggregate the count.
3. **`HAVING COUNT(*) > 1`**: Filters for rows where the count is greater than 1, indicating duplicates.
4. **`ORDER BY duplicate_count DESC`**: Orders the results by the number of duplicates, with the most frequent duplicates first.

### Optional Adjustments:

- If duplicates could occur due to other fields (like `open`, `high`, etc.), include them in the `SELECT` and `GROUP BY` clauses.
- If you're unsure about the keys for uniqueness, analyze the schema or consult with the data owner.
